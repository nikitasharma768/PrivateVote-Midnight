PrivateVote: ZK-Nullifier Anonymous Governance

Anonymity and Integrity Guaranteed by Zero-Knowledge Proofs on the Midnight Network

ðŸ’¡ The Problem and Our ZK Solution

Traditional digital voting systems force users to trust a central authority to enforce fairness (voter eligibility, one-vote-per-person). This inherently compromises privacy.

PrivateVote solves this by using the Compact language and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) on the Midnight Network. We separate privacy from integrity, allowing the system to guarantee election fairness without recording any identifying metadata about the voter. Our core innovation is the ZK Nullifier Logic within the contract's IsVoteValid circuit.


ðŸ”‘ Technical Deep Dive: The ZK Nullifier Pattern
The Nullifier pattern is the critical mechanism that mathematically guarantees a user can only vote once, while still remaining fully anonymous.


The Secret Identity (Witness): The voter provides a voter_id_secret (a u64 in the VoteDetails witness). This private token is used to generate the proof but is never stored on the public ledger.


The Anonymous Receipt (Nullifier): A nullifier_hash (Field) is generated from the secret. This hash is publicly written to the ledger and acts as an anonymous "already spent" flag, fulfilling the Nullifier function.


Fraud Prevention (Circuit Check): The core IsVoteValid circuit uses an assertion (assert(!prev_state.nullifiers.contains(...))) to check the public ledger's set of spent nullifiers. If the hash exists, the transaction is rejected, preventing the double-spend.


Admin Control (Architectural Security): The transitionÂ InitializeElection requires an IsAdmin(witness) proof, ensuring only a privileged party, verified via ZK, can deploy and set up the contract.


The final public Ledger (state) holds only the final vote tally and the set of anonymous spent Nullifiers, guaranteeing transparency and privacy simultaneously.

ðŸš€ Future Roadmap (Next Steps for the Fellowship)
Compiler Integration: Complete integration with the working compactc compiler once toolchain support is stabilized.

ZK Commitment Logic: Implement a more robust Merkle Tree or cryptographic commitment scheme for voter registration lists.

Encrypted Tally: Explore homomorphic encryption to allow complex vote tallies (e.g., ranked choice) directly on encrypted data.
